# Power-plant-data-analysis
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance. In this Project we are Implementing the Gradient Descent and also using Inbuilt Gradient Descent Regressor on the Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset to predict its output.
